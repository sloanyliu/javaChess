Sloan Liu || NQueens Stack implementation || slyliu

Strategy:
1. I first learned how to use the Stack class Java comes with
2. I then  modified the main function to place more than one pre-set Queen in the Queen array
3. Algorithm for NQueens method:
	~ Push the pre-set Queens to the Stack
	~ While the Stack is not empty:
	  - pop the top of the Stack
	  - Check for BASE CASE
	  		if statisfied, then return TRUE
	  - find an empty column
	  - push all possible Queen placements to the stack
	  		move the Queen is the placement is not valid
	  		If the placement is valid, push possibility to the stack and move the Queen
